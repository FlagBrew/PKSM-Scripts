Ever since PKSM has implemented scripting, it has greatly enhanced my enjoyment of the Pokemon Games as they have allowed me to make my own custom cheat codes for older games without having to edit my save directly and hence, can do all of my edits right on the console which is useful when you are on the go. Now I am going to contribute these scripts for others to use.
Note: Although I have been using these scripts for a while and haven't noticed any side effects, that doesn't mean there aren't any. Always backup your save beforehand.

All Games except gen 7:
Item Scripts: I have made scripts that allow you to change the item quantity and item types of certain items in your bag. However, you may notice that for a lot of these scripts, the quantities are both x999 and x65535. The x65535 is the actual cap that the game is capable of storing. It will render in game as ?35. This is impossible in Sun, Moon, Ultra Sun, and Ultra Moon, as the item format has changed and now it is impossible to set values that high or change individual quanities with scripts. For all games, I have also genreally added more items, such as Sacred Ash, Festival Tickets, Ability Capsules etc.

Diamond, Pearl, and Platinum: The current ones are Poffin Codes. Using these codes will allow you to change the poffin in that slot to a Mild Poffin with 99 in everything. This means that you only need to feed a single Pokemon 3 of these to fully max out all of their contest stats
Honey Tree Codes: These are a work on progress. Right now, there is full support for the honey tree on route 205 - south (The tree immedietly north of the bridge on the way to Valley Windworks). Using these scrips will set the Pokemon of your choice to be at the tree for 12 hours from when the game was last saved. I may add more trees later, but they are tedious, so right now, Only the one is supported


For HGSS: 
Reset Sinjoh Ruins: Allows you to bring an Arceus and repeat the events that take place within as many times as you want. Fun fact: choosing Giratina here is the only way to acquire the Grisious Orb in HGSS as it cannot be brought into union room and hence, cannot be traded in from Platinum
Reset Spiky-Eared Pichu: Allows you to bring the Event Pichu in order to receive another Spiked-Ear Pichu
Reset Red: Red will disappear when defeated and can be respawned in-game by defeating the Elite Four, but who has time for that :)
Max Pokeathelon Points: Every time you complete a Pokeathelon Event, you recieve points that you can redeem for prizes.

All  Gen 4: For these games, I have primarilty added Battle Frontier codes which allow one to set their current streak to one that will allow them to face the frontier brain at the end of that streak. Note: I haven't added anything for the Battle Hall yet beacuse I don't understand how it is stored. Although not listed, I have added support for other modes in the battle facilities as well. For Diamond and Pearl, only the Tower codes will work for hopefully obvious reasons
For Battle Tower:
14 Streak will allow you to face Tower Tycoon Palmer for the Silver Print on the 7th battle
42 Streak will allow you to face Tower Tycoon Palmer for the Gold Print on the 7th battle
98 Streak means that you only need to win 2 battles to reach 100 battles and receive a trainer star for your trainer card
49 Doubles, Multi, Link Multi- and Wifi: After winning one battle, your Pokemon will receive the respective ribbons. Note, for obvious reasons, I haven't been able to test the wi-fi room code, but I don't think it'll do you much good anyway :)

For Battle Arcade:
14 Streak will allow you to face Arcade Star Dahlia for the Silver Print on the 7th battle
42 Streak will allow you to face Arcade Star Dahlia for the Gold Print on the 7th battle

For Battle Factory: (I recommend doing Lv50 over Open level beacuse open level is level 100, so doing lv50 will make the HP bars scroll down faster:)
Lv50 Max Trades: This will set your trade count to 9999. The more trades you do, the better Pokemon you can choose to rent at the start
Lv50 - 14 Streak will allow you to face Factory Head Norton for the Silver Print
Lv50 - 42 Streak will allow you to face Factory Head Norton for the Gold Print
Open Level Max Trades: This will set your trade count to 9999. The more trades you do, the better Pokemon you can choose to rent at the start
Open Level - 14 Streak will allow you to face Factory Head Norton for the Silver Print
Open Level - 42 Streak will allow you to face Factory Head Norton for the Gold Print

Battle Castle:
Max Castle Points: This will set your CP to 9999, allowing you to buy as many upgrades, items, heals, skips etc as you want. Note, you don't unlock the ability to skip a battle until you win 21 battles.
14 Streak will allow you to face Castle Valet Darach for the Silver Print on the 7th battle
42 Streak will allow you to face Castle Valet Darach for the Gold Print on the 7th battle

BW: 
For Black and White the major codes that I made were the Black City and White Forest Codes: These codes allow you to fill your Black City or White Forest with 10 people who will each add a specific item to the Shop in Black and a wild Pokemon to the grass in White. However, there are actually two sets of the area in each game. I will refer to them as the front and the back section. The front is the area that you actually visit in your game and the people there will grant you access to a specific item or Pokemon. However, over time, they will "leave" the area if they aren't interacted with frequently enough. However, when they leave, they move to the "back" section. The back of the area is the one that other players will see if they visit your city/forest in the entralink and they can be recruited into their game. This is the only known way to refill your city/forest if it empies. Both the front and the back have a capacity of 10 people, hence if the back area is full, then people in the front will never leave. So when you click on a set, it will fill both the front and the back so your City/Forest will never get any smaller. The contents of each set are listed below
Black City White Forest Set 1: Will place Set 1 in the Front and Set 3 in the back
Black City White Forest Set 2: Will place Set 2 in the Front and Set 1 in the back
Black City White Forest Set 3: Will place Set 3 in the Front and Set 2 in the back

B2W2: 
Join Avenue - Restock all shops: This will refill all the shops contents and therefore, you can buy from all the shops again without having to wait for the next day.
Join Avenue - 7 Day Promotion: This will cause a week long promotional event. When this code is used, for one week from when the game was last saved, all the shop's items are only half price!
Join Avenue - Level 9 Shops: this code will set all of your shops to level 9 and as such, only one visior referel will be neessary to max out each shop

BW/B2W2:
People Passed Codes: Why not :)
Seasons - These codes will allow you to change the season to whatever you want. However, whenever you step outside, the game will check your 3ds calender and update the season. So use this code within the area you want to use it.
Reset N and Shadow Triad: This will allow you to rematch N and the Shadow Triad without needing to wait for the season to change (Can you tell I don't like waiting a month for certain events)
Reset Geonet: This will allow you to change the location registered on the Geonet, although the dots on the globe will remain.
Pass Power MAX codes: These codes will allow you to change your currently equiped pass powers to their MAX conterparts, these powers are the same as their level 3 powers, but will last an entire hour! However, they cost 9999 Pass orbs to use, which is more than you can legitemelty carry. Luckily, I have provided a script for x65535 Pass Orbs which makes them usable.

ORAS:
All Mirage Islands/Mountains/Caves/Forest codes: These codes will load all of the respecitve type of Mirage Spot as well as Cresent Isle (Cresselia's Loation) into the game for the rest of the day, making them accessible with the Eon Flute. However, note that due to the limited amount of islands that can be loaded into the game at once, these codes are mutually exclusive and loading one will unload the other

XY/ORAS: Almost all the codes are compatible with all of 6th gen
Battle Masion Codes: These codes are similar to the Battle Frontier in that they set your current win streak to the point in which your next battle will be against a Battle Chatelane
Supreme Honor Pokepuffs: Will fill all 100 slots of your pokepuffs with Supreme Honor Pokepuffs, which are the strongest Pokepuffs
All S and MAX O-Powers: This code is similar to the stock code. But this code also unlocks the MAX powers as well. However, without a modified game, these MAX Powers can't be used. They can't make it easy for us can they?

SM: Reset Tpye Null: This code will make it so you can receive another type null and the memory disks from Gladion at Aether Paridise
USUM:
All Rotom Powers x999: Same as the default code, but gives 999 of each roto power rather than 99
Reset Type Null: Allows you to receive another Type: Null and memory disks from Wicke at Aether Paradise
Reset Gift Totems: This will allow you to receive another set of Totem Pokemon from Sampson Oak as long as you have collected the necessary stickers.
Festival Plaza 1st Facility Codes: These codes will change the facility in the first slot of the Festival Plaza to the one of your choice. It even includes the color.
Reset Red and Blue: This code will reset the inital battle tree event in which you must battle Red or Blue, allowing you to fight them again.
SM/USUM:
Receive all Battle Tree Prizes: After executing this script, you can speak to the women at the Battle tree to receive all of the possible streak prizes. This code will only work once a day
Can Re-buy Festival Plaza Items & Services: Similar to the Join Avenue Script, this code will restock all the shops in join avenue without the need to wait for the next day. Note that in order for Switcheroo to be reset, it has to be in slot 7
Shop 6 Tent Bonuses: These codes will set the received fortune from a forune teller to the effect of yor choice. This code will only work for tents in slot 6. For multiple fortune shops, move it into slot 6, execute the script, and then move it back.
All Pokebeans: Gives you 255 of every type of Pokebean
Battle Tree Scripts: These SCripts will set your streak so you will fight Red and/or Blue on your next battle
Zygarde Cell Codes: Simialar to the default code, just with more options

Pokemon Link: These codes will allow you to acquire these event Pokemon from the Pokemon Link on the main menu. However, if you care about legality, Celebi can only come from X & Y and Glalie and Steelix can only be received from ORAS. However, for some reason, trying to inject the ORAS Demo Pokemon won't work more than once. I assume that a flag is checked when they are recieved so you can't receive them again, more research is needed.
