## Installing Scripts
If you're using PKSM v6.0.0 or later then you already have most (if not all) scripts already installed

If you're still using PKSM v5.1.x (which is no longer receiving support), do the following:
1. Download the `scripts.7z` from [this release](https://github.com/FlagBrew/PKSM-Scripts/releases/tag/v1.1)
2. Extract the contents and copy the `scripts` folder to your SD card so that its path is `/3ds/PKSM/scripts`

## Legality Warning

The following is a list of unlabeled scripts (with no legal counterpart) known to edit parts of your save to illegal values:

## Script Notes
These are notes and details that may be useful to know about scripts that couldn't be summarized to fit in scripts' names

### Mass Inject Scripts
- All mass injection scripts target the first slot of Box 1 to start injecting the collection. If you're worried about losing some of your Pokémon, make sure to clear out enough of your in-game boxes to make room
    - **Living Dex**
        - Gen 5: 22 boxes
        - Gen 6: 25 boxes
        - Gen 7: 27 boxes
    - **Colosseum**: 2 boxes
    - **XD**: 3 boxes
    - **PKX injector**: 1 slot for every `.pk*` or `.pb7` file in `/3ds/PKSM/inject`
    - everything else: 1 box
- Not all Pokémon in the mass injection scripts may be legal
- Only the "Living Dex" scripts update your dex. If you want the contents of a mass inject script to be registered but don't want the full Fill Dex, do one of the following:
    - deposit the unregistered Pokémon in the Day Care then withdraw them
    - take them into a wild battle (reported to work but not confirmed)
- **rBreedingDitto**: the Ditto in these scripts were obtained from [this list on /r/BreedingDittos](https://www.reddit.com/r/BreedingDittos/comments/2wqabp/giveaway_so_you_want_a_ditto/). They are subject to all the conditions and limits set by /r/BreedingDittos (so don't try passing them off as legal on /r/pokemontrades)

### Fill Dex Scripts
- Regional Pokédex scripts will overwrite anything you've seen (and owned if you use the "owned" version) which may cause you to lose registration of anything not in your game's regional Pokédex
- These scripts will fill your dex enough to unlock access to the following rewards:
    - `DP, Pt` **Sinnoh seen**: regional dex diploma, National dex upgrade
    - `HGSS` **Johto owned**: regional dex diploma
    - `DP, Pt, HGSS` **National owned**: national dex diploma
    - `BW` **Unova owned**: regional dex diploma
    - `BW` **National owned**: national dex diploma
    - `B2W2` **Unova seen**: Permit (for visiting Nature Preserve)
    - `B2W2` **Unova owned**: regional dex diploma, Oval Charm
    - `B2W2` **National owned**: national dex diploma, Shiny Charm
    - `XY` **Kalos seen**: Oval Charm
    - `XY` **Kalos owned**: regional dex diplomas (Central, Coastal, Mountain, Kalos)
    - `ORAS` **Hoenn seen**: Oval Charm
    - `ORAS` **Hoenn owned**: regional dex diploma
    - `XY, ORAS` **National owned**: national dex diploma, Shiny Charm
    - `SM, USUM` **Alola owned**: Shiny Charm
- **National** versions will also unlock access to all corresponding regional rewards
- **owned** versions will also unlock access to all corresponding **seen** rewards
- **Complete** versions will unlock all the same rewards as the **National owned** versions
- Only the **Complete** versions will fill in Mythicals (Mew, Celebi, Jirachi, etc.)
- Only the **Complete (illegal)** versions will unlock *all* forms and shiny sprites, including unreleased ones

### Item Scripts
- `SM, USUM` **slot 1 x897-960**: due to the way items are stored in Gen 7 saves and the current limitations of PKSM's scripts, the quantity of the item in the pouch's first slot is set to something in the range of 897 to 960 (depends on the former quantity) rather than 999 like in past generations
- `BW, B2W2` **Item slot 1 - Pass Orb x65535**: this was only added because the MAX level Pass Powers require 9999 to use, which is more than existing scripts give. Also note that the game will display the amount weirdly, like `?35`
- `Gen IV, V, VI` **All TMs and HMs**: fills your TM pouch with *all* TMs and HMs, which may cause problems with story progression

### Reset Scripts
- `all games` **Reset [pokemon]**: Allows any listed Pokémon to be re-obtained (if gift) or re-battled
- `USUM` **Reset Main Conflict**: resets everything between getting to the Altar of the Sunne/Moone and encountering Mina
- `USUM` **Reset Postgame**: resets it back to the start of the Rainbow Rocket arc, when you enter your house, you meet Sophocles and go the Festival Plaza
- `USUM` **Reset Nanu Event**: ?
- `USUM` **Reset Team Skull Pose Event**: resets the event in Po Town where you help the Team Skull Grunt who can't make the Team Skull pose
- `USUM` **Reset Janitor Event**: resets the event that happens when you talk to the janitor in Hau'oli Mall
- `USUM` **Reset Shiny Exeggcute Battle**: resets the battle against the Poni Island trainer with the shiny Exeggcute
- `USUM` **Remove Stakataka and Blacephalon**: the reset scripts for these two cause them to respawn indefinitely after capture/defeat so this script was made to allow users to end that if they want
- `USUM` **Reset Red and Blue**: resets initial Battle Tree event in which you battle Red or Blue
- `ORAS` **Reset Delta Episode**: resets back to before the battle with Wallace in front of Sky Pillar
- `BW, B2W2` **Reset Geonet**: allows you to change the location you registered on the Geonet
- `B2W2` **Reset N and Shadow Triad**: allows you to rematch the trainers without waiting for the season to change
- `HGSS` **Reset Sinjoh Ruins**: resets the event where you take an Arceus to the Ruins of Alph and eventually receive a lv1 Dialga/Palkia/Giratina holding its respective Orb
- `HGSS` **Reset Red**: respawns Red at Mt. Silver without having to defeat the Elite Four
- `DP` **Set all legendaries battlable/disappeared**: same as **Reset [pokemon]** above

### Battle Facility Scripts
- `DP, PT, HGSS, XY, ORAS, SM, USUM` **Streak**: sets the current streak to just before a battle with the facility's leader
- `PT, HGSS` **Battle Factory Max Trades**: This will set your trade count to 9999. The more trades you do, the better Pokemon you can choose to rent at the start
- `PT, HGSS` **Battle Castle Points**: This will set your CP to 9999, allowing you to buy as many upgrades, items, heals, skips etc as you want. Note, you don't unlock the ability to skip a battle until you win 21 battles.

### Black City / White Forest
These codes fill all the settlement's slots in your game with predefined residents as described below.

### Other Scripts
- `SM, USUM` **Shop 6 Tent Bonus**: set which bonus is active from the tent shop located in slot 6 (requires a tent shop to be in that slot)
- `USUM` **Set 100 hatched eggs**: set the number of hatched eggs to 100 so that you can just talk to the stats judge to unlock IV checking in the PC
- `USUM` **Set Sun/Moon time**: sets the in-game time of day, to allow access to time limited events (only available during day/night)
- `XY, ORAS` **Supreme Honor Pokepuffs**: fill all 100 Pokepuff slots with Supreme Honor Pokepuffs
- `XY, ORAS` **Pokemon Link**: These codes will allow you to acquire these event Pokemon from the Pokemon Link on the main menu. Until you claim it in-game, using more than one at a time will overwrite any you've already injected. If you care about legality, Celebi can only come from X & Y and Glalie and Steelix can only be received from ORAS. For some reason, trying to inject the ORAS Demo Pokemon won't work more than once.
- `ORAS` **Mirage Spots**: Sets the available Mirage Spots to the set selected, all of which also include Crescent Isle where you can find Cresselia. Spots will change when the date changes, and may change if you pass people through the PSS
- `BW, B2W2` **Pass Power MAX**: changes your currently equipped Pass Power. These MAX versions are as powerful as Lv3 and last for 1 full hour, but cost 9999 Pass Orbs to activate so you will need to use these along with the **Items slot 1 - Pass Orb x65535** script
- `BW, B2W2` **Season**: changes the current season of the save -- Note that changing area (leaving a building/cave, changing route, etc.) will update the season to match the system's current date
- `B2W2` **Join Avenue - Restock All Shops**: This will refill all the shops contents and therefore, you can buy from all the shops again without having to wait for the next day.
- `B2W2` **Join Avenue - 7 Day Promotion**: This will cause a week long promotional event. When this code is used, for one week from when the game was last saved, all the shop's items are only half price!
- `B2W2` **Join Avenue - Lv9 All Shops**: this code will set all of your shops to level 9 and as such, only one visitor referral will be necessary to max out each shop
- `DP, Pt` **Fulfill Spiritomb encounter requirements**: sets everything up so that you will battle Spiritomb the next time you examine the Broken Tower / Hallowed Tower on Route 209 (between Hearthome and Solaceon)
